> Freedom-of-expression laws are not there to protect statements such as “kittens are cute” – but they are there to protect unpleasant things.
> : Unnamed High Court judge

> Contentment is knowing that you are right. Happiness is knowing that someone else is wrong.
> : Bill Bailey


> Et fortasse cupressum  scis simulare; quid hoc, si fractis enatat exspes  nauibus, aere dato qui pingitur?

> History is an angel being blown backwards into the future. History is a pile of debris and the angel wants to go back and fix things, to repair things that have been broken, but there's a storm, blowing, and the storm keeps blowing the angel backwards, into the future, and this storm, this storm, is called progress.
> : Laurie Anderson

> “I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.”
> : Rutger Hauer (as Roy Batty) (Bladerunner)

>Poetry provides the one permissible way of saying one thing and meaning another.
> : Robert Frost

> “What are the facts? Again and again and again – what are the facts? Shun wishful thinking, ignore divine revelation, forget what “the stars foretell,” avoid opinion, care not what the neighbors think, never mind the unguessable “verdict of history” – what are the facts, and to how many decimal places? You pilot always into an unknown future; facts are your single clue. Get the facts!”
> : Robert Heinlein
